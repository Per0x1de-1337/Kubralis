# Kubralis: Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Management and Policy Automation

**Kubralis** is a Python-based command-line tool and server for managing Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, workloads, and advanced multi-cluster policies (such as those used by KubeStellar). It leverages the FastMCP framework and the official Kubernetes Python client to provide robust and extensible automation.
